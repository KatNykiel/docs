# Other useful packages

That's the gist of the tutorial, I hope you found it useful! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, email or slack works best.

Atom has tons of open-source packages. This is great, but it also means that you need to be careful with installing random packages. I tend to only install packages with large user bases and active communities to check for vulnerabilities.

Cool packages that didn't warrant their own pages:
- **atom-beautify**: adjusts your code to fit proper code formatting standards
- **highlight-selected**: highlights the current word selected (everywhere it appears) when double clicked
- **jumpy**: navigate around your code with dynamic hotkeys
- **minimap**: preview your full code in your scroll bar
- **pp-markdown**: live preview Markdown files (useful for writing this tutorial!)
- **split-diff**: compare differences between two files
- **todo-show**: finds all TODOs, FIXMEs, etc. in your project and compiles them into a list
- **zentabs**: sets a maximum on the number of opened tabs
