# Installation

*Atom* is a hackable text editor created by GitHub, and can be downloaded from [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

```{note} This tutorial is done on Windows, OS X/Linux may differ slightly
```

## Why Atom?
A dedicated code editor offers many advantages over pure command-line editors (vim, emacs) or SSH clients (MobaXterm, PuTTY)
- modern editing tools (code completion, customizable shortcuts, etc.)
- highly customizable
- ability to easily run code and manage files within your editor

Why specifically Atom, over other alternatives like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)?
- completely free
- thousands of open-source packages
- convenient git integration for version control

Even if you prefer one of these options over Atom, it's a major improvement over slow, rigid tools like MobaXterm
