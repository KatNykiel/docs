# Installation

## What is Atom?
*Atom* is a hackable text editor created by GitHub

## Why Atom?
A dedicated code editor offers many advantages over pure command-line editors (vim, emacs) or SSH clients (MobaXterm, PuTTY)
- modern editing tools are *magic*
  - code completion, customizable shortcuts, etc.
  - if you're really attached to vim/emacs, you can still use those within Atom as well!
- highly customizable, well documented
- ability to easily run/debug code and manage files within your editor

Why specifically Atom, over other alternatives like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)?
- completely free
- thousands of open-source packages
- convenient Git integration for version control

Even if you prefer one of these options over Atom, it's a major improvement over slow, rigid tools like MobaXterm and its default text editor.

## Inital setup

- Download and run the installer from [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

```{note} This tutorial is done on Windows using Atom 1.60.0. OS X/Linux or different Atom versions may differ slightly
```

One of the first things to do after installing Atom would be set up your workspace.

Atom uses **projects** to manage different workspaces. For example, you might have a project for [Bell](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/bell), another for [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org/), and another for local runs.

- After opening Atom, create a new project by clicking **Open a Project** on the right pane
- Choose a folder where you want your workspace to be stored
- For this example, we'll create a new folder called 'Gilbreth' we'll use to connect to the [Gilbreth cluster](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/compute/gilbreth)
