# Electrons in a Periodic Potential

- electrons can move almost as plane waves in a periodic potential
- recall that mean free path is much larger than atomic spacing
    - we need a better model

## Bloch’s Theorem

- start from a periodic potential

$$
V(\vec{r}) = V(\vec{r}+\vec{R})
$$

- the wavefunction is then

$$
\psi_k^\alpha(\vec{r}) = e^{i\vec{k}\vec{r}}U_k^\alpha(\vec{r})
$$

- where $U(\vec{r}) = U(\vec{r}+\vec{R})$
    - this means that solutions to the SE can be expressed as a free wave times some lattice periodic function
    - recall that $k$ belongs to the first BZ
    - we call this a modified plane wave
- starting from H,

$$
H = \underbrace{H_0}_{p^2/2m}+V
$$

$$
H_0|k\rang = \epsilon^{\vec{k}}_{\vec{k}}|k\rang
$$

- where $\epsilon_k^0 = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$
- now apply this function to the potential

$$
\lang \vec{k}'|V|\vec{k}\rang = FT(V(\vec{r}))_{k-k'}
$$

- the FT only returns $V_G$ if $k$ and $k'$ differ by $G$

$$
\psi_{\vec{k}}=\sum_{\vec{G}} A_{\vec{k}+\vec{g}}e^{i(\vec{k}+\vec{G})\cdot\vec{r}} = e^{i\vec{k}\vec{r}}\cdot\sum_G A_{\vec{k}+\vec{g}}e^{i\vec{G}\vec{r}}
$$

- this function is periodic in $\vec{r}$, with a pre-factor that is our plane wave

$$
\psi_{\vec{k}+\vec{G}'} = \sum_{\vec{G}} A_{\vec{k}+\vec{G}+\vec{G}'} e^{i(\vec{k}+\vec{G}+\vec{G}')\cdot\vec{r}} \\ = \sum_{\vec{G}}A_{\vec{k}+\vec{G}}e^{i(\vec{k}+\vec{G})\cdot\vec{r}}
$$

- this means that all excitations can be described in one BZ
    - we don’t need to consider all k
- we need to solve SE

$$
H\psi = E\psi
$$

- there’s two limiting cases with this problem
    - tight binding model: assume strong binding potentials (electron is almost localized on every atom), allow small tunneling
    - plane wave: plane wave on weak periodic potential

# Nearly-Free Electron Model

- completely free electrons

$$
H  = \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m} + V'
$$

- in first-order perturbation theory, we can’t get nice results

$$
\lang k'|V_g|k\rang = V_g \text{ if } k-k'=G'
$$

- to second-order,

$$
\epsilon_k = \epsilon_0 + V_g+ \sum_{k'=k+G} \frac{|\lang k'|V|k\rang|^2}{\epsilon_0(k)-\epsilon_0(k')}
$$

- now we can apply the Laue condition
- the last term diverges as we approach the BZ boundary
    - this is where it has the greatest contribution to the energy

- restrict to

$$
|\psi\rang  =\phi_k|k\rang+\phi_{k+G}|k+G\rang
$$

- therefore, where $n,m \in \{\vec{k}, \vec{k}+\vec{G}\}$

$$
\sum_mH_{nm}\phi_m = E\phi_n
$$

- from this,

$$
\lang k|H|k\rang = \epsilon_k^0 + V_0 \\ \lang k+G|H|k+G\rang = \epsilon_{k+G}^0+V_0 \\ \lang k+G|H|k\rang = \lang k+G|H_0|k\rang+\lang k+G|V|k\rang = V_{\vec{G}} \\ \lang k|H|k+G\rang = V_{\vec{-G}} = V_{\vec{G}}^*
$$

- from this, we have a proper Hamiltonian

![Untitled](545%20Lectur%20b3925/Untitled%201.png)

- at the BZ boundary,

$$
E_\pm = \epsilon_k^0+V_0\pm|V_g|
$$

- not quite at the BZ boundary, this becomes much more complicated

![Untitled](545%20Lectur%20b3925/Untitled%202.png)

- the scattering is allowed because our crystal momentum is defined in the first BZ
- G is momentum of the center of mass of the crystal
    - the crystal can absorb this momentum

### 1D case

- why does the scattering produce a gap?
    - we have some potential $V(x) = 2V'\cos(\frac{2\pi}{a}x)$
    - take a FT of the potential
    - we can describe our BZ edges as plane waves moving to the left and the right

### 2D and 3D cases

- function is a linear combination of several points in reciprocal space
- degeneracy leads to divergence
- near $\Gamma$, the dispersion is parabolic
- dispersion curves are related to selection rules (lattice + basis)
-
