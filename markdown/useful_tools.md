# Useful tools
This area is still under development. But here's some tools I've stumbled across that I wish I learned about earlier
## Pymatgen
[Pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/) is a Python library  which offers TONS of integrations with common simulation methods
- creating and parsing VASP input / output files
- generating structures, supercells
- file conversions between different crystal systems
- visualization of crystal structures

It seems to be the *de facto* Python package for computational materials science. Some of our group uses it sparsely, but there's far more potential than we're taking advantage of.

## Obsidian
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is, basically, just a way to edit Markdown files. It's extremely useful as note-taking software, especially as a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) tool. I've been using Notion for years, and while I love it, there's a few big drawbacks
- You don't own your data - Notion stores your files in the cloud, which means you don't have any local backups
- Notion is restrictive. It's great to be within the Notion system, but it doesn't translate well to presentations / building websites / coding
- You're trusting that Notion won't sell your data, lose your files, or charge premiums to continue using Notion

Local markdown files managed with Obsidian are essentially the same system as Notion, albeit without some of its luxuries. Despite this, it's still absolutely worth using Obsidian.
