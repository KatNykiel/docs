Setting up Atom
==================================

Per the suggestion of some other group members, I thought I'd write up a few pages in RTD/Sphinx describing how to set up Atom to connect with RCAC clusters.

07/10/22: Update: Atom is planned to be archived at the end of this year. I've learned a lot growing with Atom, but sadly it's time to switch to a different editor. It's been quite fun and I'm sad to say goodbye so quickly to something I imagined I'd be using for years.
VS Code currently seems like the best alternative as it has many of the same features as Atom out-of-the-box; however, an open-source solution would be preferable. 

I'll still use this site for documentation and tutorials.
